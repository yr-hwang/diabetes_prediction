# Diabetes Prediction

The purpose of this project is to create a machine learning model to predict whether a patient has diabetes or not. StandardScaler was used to standardize the data, Support Vector Machine model was used for prediction, and accuracy_score was used to evaluate the accuracy of both the training and test data.
